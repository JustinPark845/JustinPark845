Welcome to the code for my first website! -April 25, 2021

Some info about the website:
- This is the first prototype of my website with comments explaining every process.
- It features the basics of my profile and works, which will be updated continually. It is simplistic in content/detail while including some visually playful transitions.

Future plans for the website:
- My plan is to work with JavaScript to implement the transition I have on the first slide of each page onto every other slide, and to have it triggered when scrolled into view. I also plan to use JavaScript to incorporate my past python code directly onto to the website to make the my games playable for the viewer.
- Hopefully, in the future when it is more necessary, I will purchase a domain and host the website.
- I will keep adding updated information to my website as my portfolio grows.
- Add an internship/work section when it becomes relevant. Also add Wendy's, Tous les Jours, and Achieve Academy when I do.
- Add a seperate computer science section with describing miscellaneous information about my experiences such as relevant course work and gpa. Change profile computer science section to more general after.
