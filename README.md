Welcome to the code for my first website! -April 25, 2021

Some info about the website:
- This is the first prototype of my website with comments explaining every process.
- It features the basics of my profile and works, which will be updated continually. It is simplistic in content/detail while including some small playful transitions.

Future plans for the website:
- I plan to use JavaScript to incorporate my past python code directly onto to the website to make the my games playable for the viewer.
- Hopefully, in the future when it is more necessary, I will purchase a domain and host the website.
- I will keep adding updated information to my website as my portfolio grows.

- Credit to Harvard's cs50 coding course from which I learned most of my HTML, CSS, and Javascript code.
- Also credit to W3Schools for always answering my most simplest questions.
